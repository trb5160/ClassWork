<p>I'm a 29 year old prospective coder.  I was born in London, England, and lived there for about two years before I moved to my current
    resident in New Jersey.  I graduated High School in 2010, studied at Penn State University from 2010-2014, but 
    ultimately graduated from Thomas Edison State University with a bachelor's degree in Journalism.  I do not want to enter the 
    journalism industry anymore so I'm looking for a career change.I currently live in Bridgewater, New Jersey.
